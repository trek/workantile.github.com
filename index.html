      <h1>Workantile</h1>
      <p>
        We are a community of authors, programmers, lawyers, software developers, architects, 
        translators, entrepreneurs, educators, small and independent business owners, 
        and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        We'd love to meet you. Drop in and take a tour.
      </p>
      <h2>The Clubhouse</h2>
      <p>
        We share a 3000-square foot private coworking Clubhouse for casual working, heads-down focus time and printing,
        scanning, day-use lockers and indoor bike parking. We've set aside space for 
        private phone calls, have a kitchenette (stocked with snacks and coffee),
        bathroom, and conference rooms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Workantile Exchange is located at 118 S Main, halfway between Huron and Washington 
        Streets on the west side of South Main St. Need a thought-clearing break during the 
        day? Try perusing the cool comics and toys at Vault of Midnight, picking up fresh 
        strawberries at the Ann Arbor farmer's market, finish some quick shopping
        at the Kerrytown market, grab a book from the Ann Arbor District Library, 
        or nab lunch at any of the great downtown restaurants: it's all within a five
        minute walk of your Clubhouse.
