          <h2>Sponsored Events</h2>
          <p>
            Our <a href="clubhouse.html">Clubhouse</a> is maintained on behalf of our Member community.
            Occasionally we allow non-Members to hold events there.
          </p>

          <p>
            We offer our space <strong>free of charge</strong> to groups and events that support our
            Mission. Your group should be a growing <em>community of peers</em>. You don't have to be
            interested in Workantile membership, but there should be <em>active mutual interest</em>,
            promoting and supporting the region as a place for independent work.
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally, if your event generates revenue through sales or admission charges, we ask that you
            pass along 10% of the gross you collect to support Workantile Exchange.
          </p>



          <h2>Sponsorship</h2>
          <p>
            Sponsored events need to arrange for a Contributing Member <em>with at least 3
            months of community participation</em> to act as an official <strong>Sponsor</strong> <em>for
            every meeting</em>.
          
            The Sponsor should
            <ul>
              <li>... arrange for the event to be listed on the Workantile Events calendar;</li>
              <li>... announce and promote the event to other Workantile Members;</li>
              <li>... aid in growing the <em>visitors'</em> community;</li>
              <li>... be physically present at the start of each meeting;</li>
              <li>... welcome the guests to the Clubhouse, explain our norms and rules, and answer
              questions.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          
          <h2>Event Calendar</h2>
          <p>
            A half-dozen Members maintain a <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=amksgs3n13pi3jfl7he92e1c6o%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/New_York">curated Events Calendar at Google</a>. Please contact one of the curators to suggest changes.
